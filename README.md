# homework-04
 # Functionality
    The page loads when you open the url
    When you click start it pops up the first question.
    If you pick the wrong answer it takes 10 seconds off your clock and moves to the next question.
    If you pick the right answer it just moved on to the next question.
    Once all 4 questions have been answered or time runs out the quiz ends.
    You are asked for your initials and told your total questions correct.
    Once Submitted then you are brought to your past scores page and asked if you would like to try again.
# Developement Process
    I developed the page in the same way that it functions. Starting from the home page and continuing though the questions and finishing with the scores page. During this I was refining the code to do different things throughtout.
# Usage
    To use the page just click the buttons created and then enter your Initials on the final score page.
# Technologies Used
    CSS
    JS
    HTML
# Challenges Encountered
    I Struggled with the arrays and how to access the content within them. I also struggled with how to find the answer a bit. Function and how to use the parameters you set on them was also a bit of a struggle for me. I believe this homework helped me understand JS better.
